    <h2>your mission</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
    It's 9am and somebody is frantically knocking on your door...
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You open the door and Jack Bauer is right there on your doorstep looking at
    you with spirited eyes. He screams "Somebody set up us the bomb!"
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You don't understand and reply: "What you say!", and then you slap Jack
    several times to get him out of his hysteric blubbering. After a few seconds
    he seems to regain control and starts talking...
    </p>
    
    <p>
    "There is a nuclear device that is going to explode unless we stop
    it. We have only until 5pm Eastern. The bomb has been set by a
    terrorist group called Softerror.com. We have been watching them
    for months. We knew they were up to something big. But we never
    would have imagined something of this size."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You are still incredulous and ask: "So what do you want from me?"
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Jack says: "The bomb can only be stopped by breaking into the
    Softerror.com network and neutralizing the program that will
    detonate the bomb. I heard you were a l33t h4x0r. Now it's time
    to prove it for real! You need to stop the bomb!"
    </p>
    
    <p>

    Without waiting another second, you rush in front of your
    custom-order desktop machine, which has been loaded with all sorts
    of attack tools and start typing. You ask: "So what information do
    we have?" Jack replies: "We know very little. These guys have a
    public web site, at the address 10.49.27.16. Nobody has been able
    to penetrate that. There are rumors that behind the web site there
    are several different networks, one for the development of
    cyber-terror tools, one to handle their financial data, and one
    where the bomb has been set. But we don't know much about these
    networks: You are our only hope!"
    </p>
    
    <p>
    "Where do you get your information", you ask.
    </p>

    <p>
    "We have several sources inside and outside Softerror.com. However
    we have to pay a lot of money for every little piece of
    information. These guys are greedy bastards!," Jack answers, his
    voice starting to sound hopeless.
    </p>

    <p>
    You stare at your browser and you type in the address that
    Jack gave you. You know that this is only the beginning....</p>

    <h2>rules</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>rules might change on the fly</li>
      <li>do not break stuff permanently. if you screw up your target,
      your target stays screwed. if you make a mistake to the
      firewall, for instance, it stays broken unless we are kind
      enough to reset it. services run as root (you will have to get
      root in most cases anyway), so be careful.</li>
      <li>do not perform DOS attacks or spoofing. no attack requires
      spoofing your source address.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>scoring</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      work as one big team, cooperation is important, and you all
      have a single goal
      </li>
      <li>
      I will keep track of who is leading attacks and who is
      contributing, with your help.
      </li>
      <li>
      when you figure something out, you must write it up briefly and
      send it to the list and let your fellow students know
      </li>
